# Quickstart

This guide will get you all set up and ready to use the Protocol API. We'll cover how to get started using one of our API clients and how to make your first API request. We'll also look at where to go next to find all the information you need to take full advantage of our powerful REST API. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<Note>
  Before you can make requests to the Protocol API, you will need to grab your
  API key from your dashboard. You find it under [Settings &raquo; API](#).
